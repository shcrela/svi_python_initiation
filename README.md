## Things to do before we begin:

### 1. Create a new conda environment on your computer
* Open the Anaconda prompt.  
* type `conda create -n svi_formation python=3.9`  
* then type `conda activate svi_formation`  
  * optionally: `conda install -c conda-forge mamba`  
* then*: `conda install scipy numpy matplotlib scikit-image scikit-learn spyder jupyterlab ipympl`  
  * *if you decided to install mamba, replace `conda` with `mamba` in previous line.
